### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- HTML
- CSS


## Features

A web page that follows a given design as closely as possible, made responsive. I added a link back to my GitHub with a color changing animation, just for fun.

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
